# My vim config
Just my configurations for Vim.

Includes:
- Code completion and snippets with coc.nvim
- File explorer with NERDTree
- Syntax highlighting with vim-polyglot
- Search with fzf and ripgrep
- Onedark colorscheme
- Time tracking with Wakatime

I should be updating this as long as I keep changing how I use Vim (as I wish).

Feel free to use anything of these configurations or simply cloning it at `~/`.
